# Avoid
Avoid is a simpler command framework built on top of Retort. It only has input values, an no outputs, therefore returns a void for all command executions, perfect for creating simple command api's or integrating to any project.

## Retort vs Avoid
Avoid wouldn't exist without Retort, in fact it depends on it.
* Avoid doesn't have return types for command execution.
* As such, Avoid is much easier to setup with only input types.
* It has all the features Retort has!
* Avoid is basically a wrapper around Retort.
